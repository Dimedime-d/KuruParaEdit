# KuruParaEdit
These are some old Java programs I used to modify/scrape data from the GBA game Kururin Paradise.

These projects are best run in either Netbeans IDE or Visual Studio Code.

You will have to supply your own ROM of the game, and possibly the Chinese prototype, too. These ROMS should be in the following locations

```
KPCompressionWiz/res/KP - Use in Java.gba
KPCompressionWiz/res/KURUPARA_A9QC00.gba
KPDataManipulator/res/KP - Use in Java.gba
KPDataManipulator/res/KURUPARA_A9QC00.gba
```

The directories of the ROMs may be changed in the source code.
