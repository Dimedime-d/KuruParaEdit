Utility to view decompressed data in the ROM.

The same decompression algorithm is used in
- The levels (this use is obsoleted by "KuruTools" repository)
- Minigame splash screens
- Cutscene backgrounds
- Some magic screens

I only really use this to compress some data (namely translated image data) to repoint to and insert back into the rom. The other functions have no more use to me.
