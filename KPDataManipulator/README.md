A bunch of deprecated utilities, including

- Helirin angle hex conversion
- An older version of my map decompressor
- Arbitrary data table generator
- A way to find text scripts in the ROM
- A way to scrape the glyphs from the ROM
- A text frame generator, for testing width
- Some other finders, including for subroutines
- Manually tallying up the bytes in an arbitrary file

Some programs already perform the functions (like byte frequency) of this program, without the Java overhead.
